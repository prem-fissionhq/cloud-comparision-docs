**Talking Points**:
- "BigQuery changed the data warehouse game in 2012 - still ahead"
- "For analytics workloads, this is GCP's killer differentiator"
- "Many companies use GCP primarily for BigQuery, other workloads elsewhere"
- "Cost model is different - pay per query, not per hour of cluster"

**Duration**: 2 minutes

## SECTION 4: DECISION FRAMEWORK

## Slide 22: How to Choose - Decision Framework
**Visual**: Decision tree or flowchart

**Key Decision Factors**:
1. **Existing Technology Stack**
   - Microsoft ecosystem → Azure
   - Open source / Linux → AWS or GCP
   - Google Workspace → GCP

2. **Workload Type**
   - Traditional enterprise → AWS or Azure
   - Data analytics heavy → GCP
   - Container-first → GCP
   - Hybrid cloud → Azure

3. **Team Skills & Hiring**
   - Largest talent pool → AWS
   - Easiest to learn → GCP
   - Enterprise IT background → Azure

4. **Cost Sensitivity**
   - Most cost-effective → GCP
   - Most flexible pricing → AWS
   - EA discounts available → Azure

**Talking Points**:
- "There's no universal 'best' cloud - it depends on YOUR context"
- "Use this framework to evaluate your specific situation"
- "Most enterprises eventually use 2-3 clouds for different workloads"

**Duration**: 3 minutes

---

## Slide 23: Multi-Cloud Reality
**Visual**: Venn diagram showing workload distribution

**The Multi-Cloud Truth**:
- 85% of enterprises use multiple clouds
- But most have ONE primary cloud (80% of workloads)
- Others used for specific use cases:
  - GCP for BigQuery analytics
  - Azure for Windows/AD workloads
  - AWS for breadth of services

**Anti-Pattern to Avoid**:
- Building identical infrastructure across all clouds
- Result: 3x complexity, 3x cost, minimal benefit

**Better Approach**:
- Choose primary cloud for core workloads
- Use others where they truly excel
- Accept some vendor lock-in for better services

**Talking Points**:
- "Multi-cloud sounds good in theory, painful in practice"
- "Be strategic - use each cloud's strengths"
- "Perfect portability means lowest common denominator"

**Duration**: 2 minutes

---

## Slide 24: Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
**Visual**: TCO breakdown chart

**Cost Components Beyond Infrastructure**:
- **Compute & Storage**: 40-50% of cloud spend
- **Data Transfer**: 10-15% (often overlooked)
- **Training & Certification**: 5-10%
- **Operational Labor**: 30-40% (biggest cost!)
- **Tools & Third-party**: 5-10%

**Hidden Costs**:
- AWS: NAT Gateway charges, data transfer, complex pricing
- Azure: VPN Gateway costs, Synapse can spike
- GCP: Large query costs if not careful

**Cost Optimization Tips**:
- Use Reserved Instances / Committed Use (30-50% savings)
- Right-size resources (most are over-provisioned)
- Delete unused resources (dev environments at night)
- Use spot/preemptible instances for non-critical workloads
- Monitor data egress (biggest surprise bill)

**Talking Points**:
- "Sticker price isn't total cost - factor in operations and learning curve"
- "GCP often cheapest on paper, but AWS has most optimization tools"
- "Azure best if you have existing Microsoft EA discounts"

**Duration**: 3 minutes

---

## Slide 25: Migration Strategy
**Visual**: Migration roadmap timeline

**Phased Approach**:
1. **Assess** (Month 1-2): Inventory applications, dependencies, requirements
2. **Plan** (Month 2-3): Categorize workloads, choose migration patterns
3. **Pilot** (Month 3-4): 2-3 non-critical applications
4. **Iterate** (Month 5-6): Learn, adjust, build patterns
5. **Scale** (Month 6-18): Systematic migration of portfolio

**6 R's of Migration**:
- **Rehost** (Lift-and-shift): Fastest, least optimization
- **Replatform** (Lift-tinker-shift): Minor optimizations
- **Refactor** (Re-architect): Cloud-native, most benefit, most effort
- **Repurchase** (Replace with SaaS): Drop custom apps for SaaS
- **Retire**: Decommission unused apps
- **Retain**: Keep on-premises (for now)

**Talking Points**:
- "Don't try to migrate everything at once"
- "Start with dev/test environments and stateless applications"
- "Plan for 12-24 months for significant portfolio"

**Duration**: 2 minutes
