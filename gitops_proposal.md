# GitOps Deployment Strategy Proposal

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** Draft for Review

---

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a comprehensive GitOps deployment strategy designed to enforce environment-specific deployment rules, maintain code quality, and ensure secure, controlled releases across all environments.

### Key Objectives

- Automate deployment workflows while maintaining strict access controls
- Enforce branch-based deployment policies
- Implement approval gates for production releases
- Provide traceability and audit trails for all deployments

---

## 1. Deployment Strategy Overview

### 1.1 Environment-Specific Rules

Our deployment strategy enforces the following constraints:

| Environment | Source | Approval Required | Trigger |
|------------|--------|-------------------|---------|
| **Dev** | `feature/*`, `develop` branches | No | Automatic on push |
| **QA** | `release/*` branches | Yes (QA Lead) | Automatic on push with approval |
| **UAT** | Tags (`v*.*.*`) | Yes (UAT Team) | Automatic on tag creation |
| **Production** | Tags (`v*.*.*`) | Yes (Release Manager) | Sequential after UAT |

### 1.2 Core Principles

1. **Branch-Based Isolation**: Each environment has dedicated source constraints
2. **Progressive Deployment**: Changes flow through environments sequentially
3. **Tag-Based Production**: Only immutable tags can reach production
4. **Approval Gates**: Human oversight at critical stages
5. **Automated Validation**: Pre-deployment checks enforce policies

---

## 2. Workflow Architecture

### 2.1 Unified Deployment Pipeline

The solution consists of two GitHub Actions workflows:

#### **deploy.yml** - Main Deployment Workflow
- Single workflow handling all environments
- Automatic environment detection
- Conditional execution based on source type
- Built-in validation and approval mechanisms

#### **release-management.yml** - Release Operations
- Release branch creation
- Tag management
- Version tracking
- Automated PR creation

### 2.2 Workflow Diagram

```
Developer Commits
       ↓
   Feature Branch → Auto-deploy to Dev
       ↓
   Create Release Branch (release/X.Y.Z)
       ↓
   Auto-deploy to QA (with approval)
       ↓
   QA Testing & Approval
       ↓
   Merge to Master + Create Tag (vX.Y.Z)
       ↓
   Auto-deploy to UAT (with approval)
       ↓
   Auto-deploy to Production (with approval)
       ↓
   Version Update PR
```

---

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Automatic Deployments

**Development Environment**
```yaml
Trigger: Push to feature/* or develop
Validation: Branch name must match pattern
Approval: None required
Actions: Build → Deploy → Notify
```

**QA Environment**
```yaml
Trigger: Push to release/*
Validation: Must be release branch
Approval: QA Lead via GitHub Environment
Actions: Build → Test → Deploy → Notify
```

**UAT/Production**
```yaml
Trigger: Tag push (vX.Y.Z format)
Validation: Must be valid semver tag
Approval: Environment-specific reviewers
Actions: Build → Test → Deploy → Verify → Notify
```

### 3.2 Manual Deployment Capability

For emergency deployments or testing, the workflow supports manual triggers with parameters:

- **Environment Selection**: Choose target environment
- **Ref Specification**: Specify branch (dev/qa) or tag (uat/prod)
- **Approver Recording**: Document who authorized the deployment

### 3.3 Validation & Safety

**Pre-Deployment Validations:**
- Source type verification (branch vs tag)
- Naming convention enforcement
- Environment-source compatibility checks
- Duplicate deployment prevention

**Approval Gates:**
- Configured via GitHub Environments
- Required reviewers per environment
- Timeout and expiration policies
- Audit trail of all approvals

---

## 4. Release Management Process

### 4.1 Creating Release Branches

**Process:**
1. Trigger "Release Management" workflow
2. Select action: "create-release-branch"
3. Specify version (e.g., 1.2.0)
4. Workflow creates `release/1.2.0` branch
5. Automatic PR created to master
6. QA testing begins on release branch

**Automated Actions:**
- Branch creation from develop/master
- PR generation with checklist
- Labels and assignees set
- Notifications sent

### 4.2 Creating Tags & Releases

**Process:**
1. Merge release branch to master
2. Trigger "Release Management" workflow
3. Select action: "create-tag"
4. Specify version (e.g., 1.2.0)
5. Workflow creates and pushes `v1.2.0` tag
6. GitHub Release created automatically
7. Deployments to UAT/Production triggered

**Automated Actions:**
- Tag creation and push
- GitHub Release with changelog
- VERSION file updates
- Automated PR for version tracking

---

## 5. Security & Compliance

### 5.1 Access Control

**Branch Protection Rules:**
- Master branch: Require PR reviews, no direct pushes
- Release branches: Require status checks
- Feature branches: No restrictions

**GitHub Environments:**
- Each environment configured with required reviewers
- Deployment secrets scoped per environment
- Activity logs for compliance auditing

### 5.2 Audit Trail

Every deployment generates:
- Deployment ID and timestamp
- Source branch/tag reference
- Approver information
- Build artifacts and logs
- Post-deployment verification results

---

## 6. Benefits & Advantages

### 6.1 Operational Benefits

✅ **Reduced Human Error**: Automated validations prevent incorrect deployments  
✅ **Faster Releases**: Streamlined process reduces release time  
✅ **Clear Accountability**: Approval gates provide responsibility tracking  
✅ **Rollback Capability**: Tag-based deployments enable quick rollbacks  
✅ **Consistency**: Same process across all environments  

### 6.2 Business Benefits

✅ **Higher Quality**: Multiple testing stages catch issues early  
✅ **Better Compliance**: Complete audit trail for regulatory requirements  
✅ **Reduced Downtime**: Validated deployments minimize production issues  
✅ **Team Productivity**: Automated workflows free up developer time  
✅ **Risk Mitigation**: Approval gates prevent unauthorized changes
